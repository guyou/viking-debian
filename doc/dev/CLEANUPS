Cleanups:
Split up viktrwlayer.c, etc.
get rid of duplicate code (including new 1mpp topo stuff & fix that hack) in vikmaplayer.c

VikTRWlayer.c cleanup:
        and maybe viktrwlayer_dialog.c
        as much as you can fit in a week.
        file.c >> viktrwlayer.c (yeah, viktrwlayer.c could really use some extra lines of code...)?
        is there a way to split up viktrwlayer.c? it is a MESS! (split it up)
        instead of get_tracks and get_waypoints, have lookup's and insert's (actually, only gpspoint.c uses it now)
        waypoint.c with some dialog.c stuff. tool code in maybe even another file, viktrwlayer_tools.c or maybe 
viktrwlayer_menu.c
        all layer files: there are things that nolonger need to be non-static (sublayer_add_menu, properties, etc.)

AUDITS & CLEANUPS:
        no more dialog.c -- scatter it to layers' files.
        audit viklayerspanel.c, viktrwlayer.c, dialog.c, and maybe others.
        resolve nameing and semi-static stuff: dialog.c, http.c, file.c (put into viktrwlayer.c, maybe)

do a BUNCH of TODOs
