viking (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. The following changes were introduced since
    0.9.4.20080717 (which was a pre-release of 0.9.5):
    - Manpages are build and installed by upstream now, the according lines
      were removed from debian/rules and debian/viking.manpages.
    - Update of most translations
    - Google map layers stopped working due to changes by Google, this problem
      is fixed now (Closes: #491631). As this feature is used by most of our
      users, it should be fixed for Lenny.

      This doesn't affect Debian as the geocaching features are not enabled
      yet.
    - Removing unecessary (and probably ) Makefile.am directive
