viking (0.9.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Unfortunately the google maps fix in 0.9.6-1 worked only for a few days,
    hopefully the now introduced patch is a durable fix (Closes: #491631).
    - debian/control: Adding quilt to build dependencies.
    - debian/patches: Adding viking_google_fix.diff and series file.
      The patch is based on the output of
      svn diff -r739:740 \
                     https://viking.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/viking/trunk
    - debian/rules: Adding quilt.make include and dependencies on
      patch/unpatch targets.

viking (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. The following changes were introduced since
    0.9.4.20080717 (which was a pre-release of 0.9.5):
    - Manpages are build and installed by upstream now, the according lines
      were removed from debian/rules and debian/viking.manpages.
    - Update of most translations
    - Google map layers stopped working due to changes by Google, this problem
      is fixed now (Closes: #491631). As this feature is used by most of our
      users, it should be fixed for Lenny.
    - The gcget command line needed to be fixed to accommodate negative coords.
      This doesn't affect Debian as the geocaching features are not enabled
      yet.
    - Removing unecessary (and probably ) Makefile.am directive
