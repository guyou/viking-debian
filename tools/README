A collection of miscellaneous scripts which may help with Viking usage.


- viking-cache-mbtile.py

A Python2 script to create an MBTiles file from a Viking map cache.

Running the script (with no parameters) will explain the usage.


- googledirections

A bash script to get a route from Google in GPX format.

  ./googledirections "boston, ma" "new york, ny" | ../src/viking -

Note: routing via online services is built into Viking so this script is now redundant.


- images2waypoints.pl

A Perl script to auto generate basic Viking .vik files for directories containing images.

View the script itself for a more detailed description.

Note: Viking can now image open files and creates waypoints for them with the EXIF information.
 So again this script less useful.


- geo-* scripts
-- geo-html2gpx
-- geo-nearest

If Viking is compiled with 'enable-geocaches' (the default without it) then it will enable acquire Geocaches from http://www.geocaching.com via these scripts (which will need to be on your $PATH).
The scripts are Public Domain from http://geo.rkkda.com/
Note if you don't have a premium Geocaching account, getting public available geocaches is very slow.
