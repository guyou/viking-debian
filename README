To compile:

If you downloaded viking from Git, you have to:
$ autogen.sh

Next, or if you downloaded a tarball, you have to:
$ ./configure
$ make

Check output of "./configure --help" for configuration options.
In particular, it is possible to disable some features, like --disable-google in order to disable any Google stuff.

If you whish to install viking, you have to (as root):
# make install


Viking needs documentation! Any volunteers?
After I get some core features down I'll start on documentation. I promise.

To export as GPSMapper, the track/waypoint name should be in the format of:

Name RGN## 0x####

or

Name RGN## 0x##
