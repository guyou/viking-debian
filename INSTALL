UNIX:

You must have GTK+ 2.2.0 or greater installed.

if from SVN (not from prepackaged tarball):
./autogen.sh


./configure
make
make install # as root

Run "./configure --help" for some configuration options.

Try the "example.vik" file to get started.

Windows:
(Outdated info)
You must have Mingw and MSYS (?) installed. Set the path to include the GTK LIB
directory and the bin directory for mingw. Then just gcc -c each of source files
and link 'em together along with a bunch of GTK libs. I have batch files to do
all of this, I will include them in here soon. Cross-compiling with Linux
might also be possible but I've never tried it.
