  <title>Introduction</title>
<para>
Viking aims to be easy to use, yet powerful in accomplishing a wide
variety of tasks. Some of the things you can now use Viking for are:
</para>
<itemizedlist mark="opencircle"><listitem>
<para>

</sect1>
<section><title>General Concepts</title>
<para>
The panel on the left is called the <emphasis role="bold">layers panel</emphasis>.
It determines which layers and sublayers (such as tracks and waypoints)
are shown, and the order in which they are drawn. Layers list on the
top of the layers panel are drawn last. You can change the order by
drag and drop, or by selecting a layer and using the up and down
buttons at the bottom of the layers panel.
</para>
<para>
The main &appname; area where the layers are draw is called the <emphasis role="bold">viewport</emphasis>.
</para>

</section>
<section><title>Layers</title>
<section><title>TrackWaypoint Layer</title>
<para>
TrackWaypoint layers display GPS data (tracks and waypoints).
</para>
<para>An easy way to create new waypoints is to copy a
latitude/longitude coordinate pair, such as the one shown on most
geocaches, and paste it into an active TrackWaypoint layer. &appname; can
automatically recognize several variations of the lat/lon format.
</para>
<para>
By right-clicking tracks and waypoints in the layers panel, you can do
many things with tracks and waypoints. You can easily find a specific
track or waypoint by expanding the Tracks or Waypoints sublayers in the
layers panel to show all tracks or waypoints, and typing the name of
the track/waypoint.
</para>
<section><title>Layer Operations</title>
<para>
The layer has a context menu with several operations.
</para>
<section><title>Export</title>
<para>
The layer can be exported to a file GPX, GPSPoint or GPSMapper format. 
</para>
<note>
<para>
Only the entire layer can be exported, it is currently
not possible to export an individual track.
</para>
</note>

</section>

</section>
<section><title>Track Properties</title>
<para>
Show many useful statistics about a track, including a
elevation-distance graph and a speed-time graph (if data is available).
You can click these graphs to jump to the point in the track. You can
also reverse a track, delete duplicates, and split a track from its
component segments (discontinuous breaks in a track) into separate
tracks.
</para>
<para>
The following colors are used in the elevation-distance graph:
</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Brown profile</term>
<listitem><para>elevation data in graph</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Yellow</term>
<listitem>
<para>no elevation data</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Green</term>
<listitem>
<para>elevation data from DEM</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Red</term>
<listitem>
<para>speed</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

</section>
<section><title>Track Operations</title>
<section><title>Merge by time</title>
<para>
This operation repeatedly tries to merge the right-clicked track
with tracks in the same TrackWaypoint layer. The tracks which are
merged are those which have at least one trackpoint less than some
threshold time away. This way, if you somehow end up with lots of small
segments (say, caused by turning the GPS on and off) you can merge them
easily into one track.
</para>

</section>
<section><title>Split by time</title>
<para>
This operation will split a single track into segments wherever the
time interval between successive trackpoints is larger than some
threshold. This is useful when processing raw NMEA GPS data, especially
taken over a long time.
</para>

</section>
<section><title>Apply DEM data</title>
<para>
If any DEM data is loaded, this will apply the DEM data to give the track elevation data.
</para>

</section>
<section><title>Extend track end</title>
<para>
Change the current tool to add track and add points to the end of the track.
</para>

</section>
<section><title>Upload to OSM</title>
<para>
Useful if you are an OpenStreetMap.org (OSM) contributor. Viking
allowing you to import a track, edit it if you so wish to remove
duplicate points, perhaps track points leading to your home, and then
directly export the track to OSM
</para>

</section>
<section><title>View Google Directions</title>
<para>
Launch a web browser to see the Google directions page which
yielded the route.
</para>
<note>
<para>
The record of the Google route is stored in
the track's comment, so if the comment is changed (or the route was
created by something other than the Magic Scissors tool) this will not
work correctly.
</para>
</note>

</section>

</section>
<section><title>Waypoint Operations</title>
<section><title>Goto Geocache page</title>
<para>
If the waypoint's name is in Geocache form (GCXXXXX) you can launch a web browser to go to the Geocache page.
</para>

</section>

layer of the GPS layer (either by creating waypoints/tracks in it, or
copying and pasting or dragging waypoints/tracks from another layer).
Then right-click the GPSLayer and click <guimenuitem>Upload to GPS</guimenuitem>.
</para>

</section>
<section><title>Realtime tracking</title>

<para>
1. You will notice the maps are being drawn on top of the tracks, which
is probably not what you want. Look at the Layers Panel to the left.
Notice how the layer named Map is ABOVE your TrackWaypoint layer that
your GPS data is in. This means that it will be drawn last, or on top
of the other layers. Select the Map layer from the list and click the
down arrow button beneath the list. Your tracks will now be drawn over
the map. </para>

<section><title>Uploading data to OpenStreetMap</title>
<para>
It is possible to upload data directly from Viking to OpenStreetMap.
</para>
<formalpara>
<title>Upload a layer</title>
<para>
One solution is to upload whole a TrackWaypoint layer. To do this,
simply select the layer and right click on it. Then, select <guimenuitem>Upload to
OSM</guimenuitem>.
</para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Upload a single track</title>
<para>One solution is to upload whole a TrackWaypoint layer. To do
this, simply select the layer and right click on it. Then, select
<guimenuitem>Upload to OSM</guimenuitem>.
</para>
</formalpara>
<formalpara>
<title>Fill in the form</title>
<para>
On both case, Viking will reclaim some informations.
The email field is the email you used to subscribed into OSM.
The password field is the password you used with this account.
The filename is the name you want your upload has on the server. This information is displayed by the osm server.
The description is some descriptive information.
The tags field is a white separated list of tag.

<para>
HOWTO GEOCODE YOUR PHOTOS AND SEE THEM IN VIKING 
</para>
<para>1) Synchronize your camera's clock with your GPS clock. If your
camera's clock doesn't have a seconds value you can change, you might
try setting the minute value just when the minute changes.
</para>
<para>
2) Activate the track log on your GPS.
</para>
<para>3) Get outside and take some pictures with your camera while
making sure your GPS has reception. If you forgot to turn your GPS on
or forgot to bring it when you took a picture but you know where you
took the picture, you can make a waypoint with a name of the format
YYMMDDhhmm, representing the time the picture was taken, to record
where you were at that time.
</para>
<para>4) Get home and download your pictures and GPS data. You can
download the GPS data several ways. The first is using gpspoint to
download from a Garmin GPS: <programlisting>gpspoint -p /dev/ttyS0 -dw -dt -of 2004-04-02-trip1</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
Where /dev/ttyS0 is the serial port the GPS is connected to. If you
don't have a Garmin GPS, or if you don't feel like install gpspoint,
you can use my version of gpsbabel with support for gpspoint files. You
can use gpsbabel to either translate the GPS data from a format you
already have the data in or download it directly from your GPS
reciever. A typical command line would something like this:<programlisting>gpsbabel -i garmin -f /dev/ttyS0 -o gpspoint -F 2004-04-02-trip1</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
5) Launch GPSPhoto.
</para>
<para>
6) You must now bring your photos into GPSPhoto. Either drag them (or
the directory containing them) from your favorite file manager to the
list on the left of the GPSPhoto window, or use the buttons below the
list to find them.
</para>
<para>
7) Do the same for your GPS data file(s), dragging them to the list on the right of the GPSPhoto Window.
</para>
<para>8) Click the Execute button, and choose a location to save the
gpspoint file containing the waypoints for your photos. Then click OK
to write the waypoints to this file.
</para>
<para>
9) Open Viking and open both your original GPS data file and your image waypoint file just created.
</para>

    <title>Extending Viking</title>

      <para>Currently, &app; has some extention points based on configuration files. The file format is heavily inspired by the GtkBuilder file format: you specify the class of the GObject to build and set its properties. Technically, it is a XML file containing a "objects" root element. Inside this element, you set a collection of "object".</para>
      <para>Here is an example:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<objects>
  <object class="ClassName">
    <property name="property_name1">Property value</property>
